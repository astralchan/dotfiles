These are little scripts I use on my personal machine. These scripts are
originally inspired from Luke Smith's scripts. These scripts are an attempt to
be more portable and be compatible with IEEE / Open Group 1003.1-2017
(POSIX.1-2017) sh command language. These scripts are tested on `dash` and
`mksh`.

# Description

These are some scripts for dmenu / alsa.

The battery script should work anywhere.

The `chars` file is extracted from
[emoji-15.0-emoji-sequences](https://unicode.org/Public/emoji/15.0/emoji-sequences.txt)
and
[emoji-15.0-emoji-zjw-sequences](https://www.unicode.org/Public/emoji/15.0/emoji-zwj-sequences.txt)
. It's a list of every emoji listed in the unicode standard followed by a space
and a description on each line. The file should be useful for any unicode
script, and can be moved to `wl-copy` and `bemenu` easily enough.
