These are little scripts I use on my personal machine. These scripts are
originally inspired from Luke Smith's scripts. These scripts are an attempt to
be more portable and be compatible with IEEE / Open Group 1003.1-2017
(POSIX.1-2017) sh command language. These scripts are tested on `dash` and
`mksh`.

# Description

These are some scripts for bemenu / alsa.

The battery script should work anywhere.

The emojis are extracted from
[emoji-15.0-emoji-sequences](https://unicode.org/Public/emoji/15.0/emoji-sequences.txt)
,
[emoji-15.0-emoji-zwj-sequences](https://www.unicode.org/Public/emoji/15.0/emoji-zwj-sequences.txt)
, and
[emoji-15.0-emoji-test](https://unicode.org/Public/emoji/14.0/emoji-test.txt).
The font awesome characters are extracted from the
[Font Awesome Pro Cheatsheet](https://fontawesome.com/v5/cheatsheet/pro).

The format is the symbol, a space, and a description. The script to use them
can easily be replaced with `xclip` / `dmenu` if using xorg.

Might switch to fork-awesome instead of font-awesome.

# License

These scripts are released into the public domain.

To see the emojis, there are plenty of free emojis such as noto. For the font
awesome symbols, there is a free version - but to see all of them, you would
want a pro version.
